# PolygonProgram

It was a program written for my friend for his programming project, 
designed to provide visualisation of creating a geometric shape.

User creates points by writing coordinates, order of them matters.
After writing at least 3 of them, a geometric shape will appear.

After creating a shape, we can add points which will make some calculations and will appear on screen with RED dot,
if they're outside of geometric shape, GREEN dot - if the point is inside geometrical figure.

Furthermore we can observe those points in table, points that create geometric shape are separated from rest.
